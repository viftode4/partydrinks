# Authentication Flow

The Party Drinks application uses NextAuth.js for authentication, with a custom credentials provider that validates against users in the Supabase database.

## Registration Flow

1. User fills out the registration form at [app/auth/signup/page.tsx](mdc:app/auth/signup/page.tsx)
2. User provides username, password, and uploads a profile picture
3. The profile image is uploaded to Supabase storage using [lib/storage.ts](mdc:lib/storage.ts)
4. User data is submitted to the registration API at [app/api/auth/register/route.ts](mdc:app/api/auth/register/route.ts)
5. After successful registration, the user is automatically signed in and redirected to the leaderboard

## Login Flow

1. User enters credentials in the login form at [app/auth/signin/page.tsx](mdc:app/auth/signin/page.tsx)
2. NextAuth.js validates credentials against the Supabase database
3. On successful login, the user is redirected to the leaderboard or the original requested page

## Protected Routes

All routes requiring authentication are protected by the middleware:

- The [middleware.ts](mdc:middleware.ts) file handles authentication checks and redirects
- Unauthenticated users trying to access protected routes are redirected to the login page
- Authenticated users trying to access auth pages are redirected to the leaderboard

## Session Management

- NextAuth.js handles session management with JWT tokens
- The auth configuration is defined in [lib/auth.ts](mdc:lib/auth.ts)
- The [components/auth-provider.tsx](mdc:components/auth-provider.tsx) component provides session context to the application

## Authentication Logic

- When a user hits the root path (`/`), the [app/page.tsx](mdc:app/page.tsx) page checks auth status:
  - Authenticated users are redirected to `/leaderboard`
  - Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/auth/signin`

- Auth pages ([signin](mdc:app/auth/signin/page.tsx) and [signup](mdc:app/auth/signup/page.tsx)) check session status:
  - If already authenticated, redirect to `/leaderboard`
  - Otherwise, display the auth form

## Security Considerations

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds
- JWT tokens are encrypted using the NEXTAUTH_SECRET environment variable
- Session tokens have a 30-day expiration by default

## Key Components

- **Registration Form**: [app/auth/signup/page.tsx](mdc:app/auth/signup/page.tsx)
- **Registration API**: [app/api/auth/register/route.ts](mdc:app/api/auth/register/route.ts)
- **Auth Provider**: [components/auth-provider.tsx](mdc:components/auth-provider.tsx)
- **User Database Functions**: [lib/db.ts](mdc:lib/db.ts)
